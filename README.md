# face-recognition-using-opencv
Here you will find the implementation of face recognition in three steps including dataset gathering followed by training on the images gathered followed by real time face recogntion.

# How to run:-
- run the 01_face_detect.py which will take the dataset of your faces.
- run the 02_face_trainer.py which traines on the images taken using LBPH algorithm.
- run the 03_face_recognizer.py for real time face recogntion.
